# What is Kedro?

Kedro is an open-source Python framework to create reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code. It uses software engineering best practices to help you build production-ready data science pipelines.

Kedro is hosted by the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/), and you can find the [Kedro source code on GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro).

## Learn how to use Kedro

In the following few chapters, you will learn [how to install Kedro](../get_started/install.md) and discover the [key Kedro concepts](../get_started/kedro_concepts.md).

- The first example illustrates the [basics of a Kedro project](../get_started/new_project.md) using the Iris dataset
- You can then review the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial_template.md) to build a Kedro project for hands-on experience

For new and intermediate Kedro users, there's also a comprehensive section on [how to visualise Kedro projects using Kedro-Viz](../visualisation/kedro-viz_visualisation.md) and [how to work with Kedro and Jupyter notebooks](../notebooks_and_ipython/kedro_and_notebooks).

Use the left-hand table of contents to explore the documentation available for more advanced Kedro usage and deployment. We also recommend the [glossary](../resources/glossary.md) and the [API reference documentation](/kedro) for additional information.

## Assumptions

We have designed the preliminary documentation and the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md) for anyone new to Kedro. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

```{note}
There are many excellent online resources for learning Python, but you should choose those that reference Python 3, as Kedro is built for Python 3.7+. There are plenty of curated lists of online resources, such as the [official Python programming language website](https://www.python.org/) and this list of [free programming books and tutorials](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#python).
